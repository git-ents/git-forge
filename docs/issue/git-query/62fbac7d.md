# Every demand round re-parses the program and re-serializes the whole fact set to CSV from cold, and explain pays for a third full run

**What**
The demand loop calls `engine::run` once per round. Each call rebuilds the entire Nemo program text, re-serializes every fact table to a CSV string, constructs a fresh tokio current-thread runtime, re-parses the program, and evaluates from scratch. A k-round query pays k times for work that is identical across k-1 of those rounds. `explain` then runs the whole thing again.

**Where**
- `crates/gix-query-eval/src/demand.rs:130` -- `let mut engine = engine::run(program, &tables)?;` inside `for round in 1..=max_rounds`
- `crates/gix-query-eval/src/engine.rs:50-73` -- program text and CSV rebuilt per call; `csv_of` re-serializes *all* rows, not the delta
- `crates/gix-query-eval/src/engine.rs:243-249` -- `block_on` builds a new runtime per call
- `crates/gix-query-eval/src/engine.rs:41-45` -- the cost is acknowledged: "Every round of the demand loop calls this from cold: Nemo has no incremental entry point, so a k-round query pays k times."
- `crates/gix-query-eval/src/engine.rs:214-217` -- `trace_fact` calls `run` again
- `crates/gix-query/src/lib.rs:157` -- `max_rounds` is hardcoded to `64`

**Why it matters**
The tables grow monotonically across rounds, so round k re-serializes everything rounds 1..k-1 already serialized. That is quadratic in total bytes written against round count, on top of re-parsing. The spike measured the parse path at roughly 109 KB/s (`DEVPLAN.md:809-812`) and that is why facts go through CSV rather than program text -- but the *program* still goes through the parser every round, and the CSV is regenerated whole.

For a demo repository this is invisible. For a policy over a real history with a deep demand chain -- which is the use case the project exists for, and the one a "does this scale" question will target -- it is the dominant cost, and it is entirely on this side of the boundary. The DEVPLAN calls incrementality out of scope (`DEVPLAN.md:836-838`), which is fair, but "reuse the CSV we already built" is not incrementality, it is not throwing work away.

Two related constraints worth naming in the same breath, since they share the root cause of "Nemo owns the process":
- `execute()` enters a process-global timing mutex, so one evaluation per process, ever (`engine.rs:5-8`, `DEVPLAN.md:817-820`). Any embedding -- a CI runner, a server, a forge -- gets a hard serialization point that no type expresses.
- `max_rounds` at 64 is a magic literal in the facade with no way to raise it and, on exhaustion, a `DemandDidNotConverge` error rather than a diagnosis of which demand relation kept growing.

**Options**
- Option A -- cache the CSV per relation and append only new rows between rounds; cache the program text once outside the loop, since the comment at `demand.rs:99-103` already establishes the rule text never changes between rounds. Removes the quadratic term for a modest amount of bookkeeping.
- Option B -- A, plus hoist the tokio runtime out of `block_on` into a value the loop owns. The comment at `engine.rs:236-242` argues against holding one across rounds because the global mutex already serializes; that is true but it is an argument about concurrency, not about construction cost.
- Option C -- measure first. There is a conformance suite and a spike report but no benchmark of the loop itself against round count. Without one, this is reasoning about a cost nobody has weighed.

**Recommendation**
C, then A. I am confident the quadratic serialization is real from reading the code, and much less confident it matters at the sizes this tool will actually see -- which is exactly why the benchmark comes first. Also expose `max_rounds` and make its exhaustion error name the demand relation that was still growing; that turns an opaque failure into a debuggable one.
